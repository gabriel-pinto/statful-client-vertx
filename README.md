# README

Project that enables metrics collection for [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) based projects and report them to [Telemetron](http://telemetron.io/) 

This client leverages the capabilities provided by [Vert.x SPI](http://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/spi/metrics/VertxMetrics.html) to collect metrics.

Please check the project pom.xml to see Vert.x version dependency since this will be a moving target, the aim is to always support the latest stable version.
